# Dynamic Programming
### What is DP?
Break the bigger problem in sub-problems and then solve sub-problems first so that they are ready when it's needed to made up the bigger problem.

We need to make sure that it follows DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) properties:
* Graph = Vertices + Edges
* Edges have directions
* Acyclic means can't come back to the same vertex from where it started. In short don't fall in a loop.

Here we will solve few dynamic programming related problems.

## we will use two main techniques here for dynamic programming
1. Memoization
2. Tabulation
